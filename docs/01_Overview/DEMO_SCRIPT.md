# Demo Script for Founder Review

## Quick Demo Setup

### 1. Start the Collaboration Server
```bash
cd jupyter-collaboration
python -m jupyter lab --port=8888 --config=jupyter_server_config.py
```

### 2. Open Multiple Browser Windows
- Open `http://localhost:8888` in Browser 1 (User 1)
- Open `http://localhost:8888` in Browser 2 (User 2)

### 3. Demo Steps

#### Step 1: Create a Collaborative Notebook
1. In Browser 1: Create a new notebook
2. Add some code cells with Python code
3. Save the notebook as `demo_collaboration.ipynb`

#### Step 2: Share the Notebook
1. Click the collaboration icon in the left sidebar
2. Click "Share" to generate a shareable link
3. Copy the link

#### Step 3: Join Collaboration (Browser 2)
1. Paste the share link in Browser 2
2. Observe that both users can see each other's cursors
3. Both users can edit the same notebook simultaneously

#### Step 4: Demonstrate Real-time Features
1. **Cursor Tracking**: Move cursor in Browser 1, see it in Browser 2
2. **Simultaneous Editing**: Both users type in different cells
3. **User Panel**: Show connected users in the collaboration panel
4. **Live Updates**: Changes appear instantly across browsers

#### Step 5: Advanced Features
1. **Document Forking**: Create a fork of the collaborative document
2. **User Management**: Show user information and status
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Demonstrate Y.js operational transformation
